# Duck-Game
This was just a silly project that I had to code. Just a little duck game generator, and at the time I was doing this, I was still fairly new, so changing the color was a bit of a challenge. And more additionally I think I had a bug with the randomizer code, but I eventually got it to work. Turned out to be a silly spelling mistake if I recall.
